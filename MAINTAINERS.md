## Becoming a Maintainer

Bifold within the Hyperledger Aries community welcomes contributions.

Contributors may progress to become a maintainer. To become a maintainer the following steps occur, roughly in order.

- 5 **significant** changes have been authored by the proposed maintainer and accepted.
- The proposed maintainer has the sponsorship of at least one other maintainer.
  - This sponsoring maintainer will create a PR modifying the list of
    maintainers.
  - The proposed maintainer accepts the nomination and expresses a willingness
    to be a long-term (more than 6 month) maintainer.
  - This would be a comment in the above PR.
  - This PR will be communicated in all appropriate communication channels. It
    should be mentioned in any maintainer/community call. It should also be
    posted to the appropriate mailing list or chat channels if they exist.
- Approval by at least 3 current maintainers within two weeks of the proposal or an absolute majority of current maintainers.
  - These votes will be recorded in the PR modifying the list of maintainers.
- No veto by another maintainer within two weeks of proposal are recorded.
  - All vetoes must be accompanied by a public explanation as a comment in the
    PR for adding this maintainer
  - The explanation of the veto must be reasonable.
  - A veto can be retracted, in that case the approval/veto time-frame is reset.
  - It is bad form to veto, retract, and veto again.
- The proposed maintainer becomes a maintainer
  - Either two weeks have passed since the third approval,
  - Or an absolute majority of maintainers approve.
  - In either case, no maintainer presents a veto.

## Removing Maintainers

Being a maintainer is not a status symbol or a title to be maintained indefinitely. It will occasionally be necessary and appropriate to move a
maintainer to emeritus status. This can occur in the following situations:

- Resignation of a maintainer.
- Violation of the [Hyperledger Code of
  Conduct](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Hyperledger+Code+of+Conduct) warranting removal.
- **Inactivity**.
  - A general measure of inactivity will be no commits or code review comments for one reporting quarter, although this will not be strictly enforced if the maintainer expresses a reasonable intent to continue contributing.
  - Reasonable exceptions to inactivity will be granted for known long term leave such as parental leave and medical leave.
- Other unspecified circumstances.

Like adding a maintainer the record and governance process for moving a maintainer to emeritus status is recorded in the github PR making that change.

Returning to active status from emeritus status uses the same steps as adding a new maintainer. Note that the emeritus maintainer already has the 5 required significant changes as there is no contribution time horizon for those.
