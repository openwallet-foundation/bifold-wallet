## Becoming a Maintainer

Bifold Wallet, part of the OpenWallet Foundation community, encourages contributions.

Contributors can become maintainers by following these steps, listed in their general order:

1. **Contribute Significantly**: You need to have made at least 5 significant contributions that have been accepted.
2. **Get a Sponsor**: A current maintainer must sponsor you.
   - Your sponsor will propose your addition by creating a pull request (PR) to update the list of maintainers.
   - You must accept this nomination and agree to be a maintainer for at least 6 months. Confirm your acceptance in a comment on the PR.
   - The nomination will be announced in all relevant communication channels, including maintainer/community calls and any applicable mailing lists or chat channels.
3. **Gain Approvals**: At least 3 current maintainers must approve your nomination within two weeks, or you must receive approval from a majority of current maintainers.
   - Approvals are recorded in the PR.
4. **Avoid Vetoes**: No maintainer should veto your nomination within two weeks.
   - Vetoes must be publicly explained in the PR comments and be reasonable. Vetoes can be withdrawn, but this resets the approval/veto period.
5. **Officially Become a Maintainer**: You become a maintainer if:
   - Two weeks pass after receiving the third approval without any vetoes, or
   - A majority of maintainers approve your nomination without any vetoes.

This process ensures a transparent and fair path to becoming a maintainer.

## Removing Maintainers

Being a maintainer is about active participation, not just holding a title. Sometimes, it's necessary to change a maintainer's status to emeritus for reasons such as:

- A maintainer choosing to resign.
- A breach of the Linux Foundation Code of Conduct that leads to removal.
- Inactivity, defined loosely as no commits or review comments for one reporting quarter. However, exceptions are made for maintainers who plan to return to active contribution after a absences.
- Other specific situations not listed here.

The process for changing a maintainer to emeritus status is documented through a GitHub pull request (PR).

To return from emeritus to active status, a maintainer follows the same procedure as a new maintainer. Since emeritus maintainers have already made significant contributions, they don't need to meet the requirement for new contributions.
