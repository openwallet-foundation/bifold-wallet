### Patches

#### @credo-ts-core-npm-0.5.11-9122d8c9b8.patch
Patch to fix two separate issues. One, fix websocket close handling to allow graceful agent shutdown, and two, ensure listeners are reactivated properly after agent shutdown and consecutive initialize. The websocket part will no longer be needed in Credo 0.6.x but no ETA yet on when the listener reactivation will be included. Here is the websocket PR:

#### @credo-ts-react-hooks-npm-0.6.0-3c59ce13d2.patch
